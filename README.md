# Chillout UI Rework by Slime
This is a modification of the UI of ChilloutVR made by Slime-Senpai.

# How to Use
## Installation
To use this UI, simply drop the github into your UIResources folder(Steam\steamapps\common\ChilloutVR\ChilloutVR_Data\StreamingAssets\Cohtml\UIResources)
and then override the files if needed.

## Version checking
The UI will automatically check for updates everytime you start the game. The color of the version representing its current state:
- Green: Up To Date
- Red: Can be updated
- Blue: UI Version doesn't exist in database, but is above all versions for that CVR Version
- Violet: UI Version doesn't exist and there is a better version available
- No Color: Problem with the server

## Saving Config
You like some colors and would want to get them on startup instead of having to redo them all the time? Simply open slimyConfig.js with a text editor and change the default values.

# Got a bug?
Feel free to report any bug using the issue system of github or by contacting me.

# Disclaimer
ChilloutVR is a game owned by ABInteractive, therefore the UI is also theirs.
I am only making a modified version of it since I feel like it and I'm not taking credit for that.
